## Week 3 — Neural Network (MNIST)
- Built a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits
- Achieved 92% accuracy without any hidden layers.
- However, after adding a hidden layer, the accuracy was improved to 97%
- Learned: activation functions, model training, validation accuracy, loss curves
